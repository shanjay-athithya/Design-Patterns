Design a simulation system for a car manufacturing company.

Implement the Abstract Factory pattern to create a car production

system that supports different car models such as Sedan, SUV, and

Hatchback. Each car model has specific components such as engine,

body type, and interior design. The system should allow the factory to

produce cars of different models by using the appropriate set of

components. Demonstrate the functionality of the system by creating

instances of different car models using the Abstract Factory pattern

and showcase the unique features and components of each car model.
